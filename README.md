Welcome to the group311-client wiki!

This project is one part out of a client-server system. This is the client and it will connect to the server to play the board game Ticket to Ride.

It is built using the Slick2D framework and send data back and forth to the server using TCP sockets.

In the current release, a server must be started followed by 4 clients, the server and client should all open sockets on localhost if they're run on the same computer.
